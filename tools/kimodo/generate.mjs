/**
 * generate.mjs — drive Kimodo's own `kimodo_gen` CLI on the configured box and
 * bring the result back as cskel27 motion arrays.
 *
 * The CUDA route uses Kimodo's CLI directly for multi-prompt sequencing
 * (`--duration "3.0 2.0"`) and constraint files, so the whole backend is: run
 * the CLI, copy the npz back, convert somaskel77 → cskel27. Local MLX uses
 * mlx-generate.py to retain the runtime arrays; it and cpp share the native
 * SOMA77 output converter before entering the same NPZ path.
 *
 * PROMPT SEGMENTATION IS BY PERIOD. `kimodo_gen "A. B." --duration "3 2"`
 * splits the prompt on sentence boundaries and pairs them with the durations
 * in order, so a prompt containing its own period would silently shift every
 * later segment onto the wrong duration. joinPrompts refuses that instead.
 *
 * SCHEDULED INPAINTING lands here rather than in the bridge because this is the
 * only layer that knows the GENERATION clock. The bridge speaks the app's 24 fps
 * clip frames; the wrapper scripts speak seconds; genFps and the generated frame
 * count are resolved below, for buildRoot2dConstraints, and the preserve mask is
 * built from the same pair. Computing the frame count a second time upstream is
 * exactly how the two would drift, and a mask whose length disagrees with the
 * clip by one frame is a hard error on the box.
 *
 * PRESERVE AND WAYPOINTS SHARE ONE INVOCATION (round 2, contract C3v2). They
 * travel by different channels and always have: the authored path becomes root2d
 * entries in the constraints FILE, while the base motion, the sigmas and the mask
 * are CLI flags. Nothing had to be merged for them to coexist — the only thing
 * that stood between them was the bridge's refusal, and the mask's `root` group
 * (freed end to end via `preserve.rootFree`) is what stops the two from arguing
 * over the trajectory once they do meet.
