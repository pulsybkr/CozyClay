/**
 * runner.mjs — Kimodo backend for the generation bridge.
 *
 * Implements the same runner surface as tools/ardy/runners/{local,remote}.mjs
 * ({ mode, describe, probeHealth, listBases, singleCommand, sequenceCommand,
 * editCommand }) so bridge.mjs needs no backend-specific branch: it spawns the
 * returned command and greps its `done - <path> (<bytes>)` line exactly as it
 * does for ARDY.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BACKEND DOES NOT DO. Kimodo is wired here for text-to-motion
 * sequencing, root 2D paths, pinned poses, motion edit and scheduled
 * inpainting. Base clips remain ARDY-specific machinery in this repo (a base
 * clip is autoregressive history, which Kimodo has no input for) and refuse by
 * name instead of silently producing a take that ignored them.
 *
 * HOW SCHEDULED INPAINTING TRAVELS. Between this runner and the code that
 * actually builds the kimodo_gen command line (tools/kimodo/generate.mjs) sit
 * the two wrapper scripts run-sequence-on-box.mjs and run-edit-on-box.mjs,
 * whose argv is a stable contract shared with the ARDY wrappers. Preserve
 * inputs therefore ride the ENVIRONMENT, which is the channel every other
 * Kimodo tunable already uses (CCLAY_KIMODO_GEN_FPS, _DIFFUSION_STEPS,
 * _TRANSITION_FRAMES ...):
 *
 *   CCLAY_KIMODO_PRESERVE     JSON {basePath, sigmaS, sigmaE, strength,
 *                             editRanges, maskPath, rootFree}
 *   CCLAY_KIMODO_NATIVE_OUT   where this run keeps Kimodo's own npz, so a LATER
 *                             run can preserve from it
 *
 * The round-2 additions ride the same channel untouched: `editRanges[i].tracks`
 * scopes a range to its mask groups, and `rootFree` (set by the bridge when the
 * request also carries waypoints) frees the mask's `root` group for the whole
 * clip so the authored path owns the trajectory. Neither needs a flag here —
 * boxEnv forwards the preserve object verbatim and generate.mjs is the only
 * layer that interprets it. Waypoints themselves still travel on ARGV
 * (`--root-2d`), so a preserve + waypoints run uses BOTH channels at once; that
 * is why they compose without a merge step.
