 * strictly overlap this object's (EPS keeps edge abutments out), only
 * surfaces whose top is at or below the object's current base are support;
 * the object lands with its base exactly on the highest such top, or on the
 * floor when there is none. An object already penetrating a surface is
 * therefore NOT supported by it and falls through — the recovery is to raise
 * Y above the box and press End again. The deferred alternative (a bounded
 * penetration threshold) is cut because the user cannot see the threshold
 * and a second End press would differ from the first.
 *
 * The contact height is exact, never snapped to the 5 cm grid, and never
 * clamped here: the y clamp stays in updateSceneObject, the single owner.
