// The editor's Studio actions: ONE registry whose entries call the same
// handlers the UI controls call, so a timeline button and the agent's
// run_action share one code path. Each command module registers its own
// actions over `ports`, the one generic port object App refreshes on every
// render; `ports.state()` reads the synchronously published document, so an
// action sees its own edit at once.
